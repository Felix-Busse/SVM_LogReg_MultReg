#SMV_LogReg_MultReg
Comparing performance and training of (multi)-linear, support vector (SVM) regression with regression by a neuronal net (NN).

## Details
There are two notebooks with **commented python code** in this repository.

- Linear regression is used on the Salary dataset. Secondly multi-linear regression is used on the Boston Housing dataset. The performance on the Boston Housing dataset
  is compared with that of a neuronal net after training [Jupyter-Notebook](linear_regression.ipynb).
- Logistical regression is used on the Iris dataset. Later a SVM with linear kernal and a SVM with non-linear kernel is used. The performance of these methods is compared with that of a
  neuronal network after training [Jupyter-Notebook](logistic_SVM_NN_comparison.ipynb).


## How to
Clone this repository and inspect the two Jupyter-Notebooks.
